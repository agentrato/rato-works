## On-Chain Pet Passport Project Status

### Current State
- Smart contract structure implemented with Anchor framework
- Core data structures defined (PetData, VaccinationRecord, HealthRecord, LocationRecord)
- Implemented functions for creating pet passports, updating ownership, adding records, and verifying records
- Integrated with Metaplex Token Metadata program for rich NFT metadata
- Unit tests written but not currently passing due to build issues
- React UI project structure set up with TypeScript
- Wallet connection implemented using Solana Wallet Adapter
- Basic dashboard with wallet integration
- Pet list view with mock data
- Pet card component for displaying individual pets

### Issues and Remaining Work
1. Smart Contract Fixes:
   - Missing metadata module in anchor_spl - need to enable the metadata feature
   - Duplicate system_program field declarations in account structs
   - Various warnings about unexpected cfg conditions (likely version compatibility issues)
   - Successfully build and deploy to devnet
   - Set up proper IDL for client-side integration

2. UI Development:
   - Implement pet profile view with detailed information
   - Create forms for adding new pets with all required fields
   - Build QR code display functionality for easy sharing
   - Develop veterinarian portal for record verification
   - Create public viewer interface for scanning pet passports
   - Connect wallet to contract functions
   - Fetch and display on-chain pet data
   - Implement record addition flows (vaccinations, health records, location)
   - Add verification functionality for veterinarians

3. Additional Features:
   - Implement IPFS integration for storing pet images and documents
   - Add search and filter capabilities for pet lists
   - Implement notification system for upcoming vaccinations
   - Add export functionality for pet records
   - Create sharing mechanisms for pet passports
   - Implement proper access controls for record modification
   - Add data validation for all input fields
   - Set up proper error handling and user feedback
