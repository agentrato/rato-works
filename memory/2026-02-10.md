## Pet Passport Project Development

### Smart Contract Progress
- Created project structure for Anchor-based smart contract
- Implemented core smart contract logic in Rust:
  - Pet data structures (PetData, VaccinationRecord, HealthRecord, LocationRecord)
  - Core functions: create_pet_passport, update_owner, add_vaccination_record, add_health_record, add_location_record, verify_record, get_pet_data
  - Integration with Metaplex Token Metadata program for rich token metadata
- Wrote comprehensive unit tests for all smart contract functions
- Encountered build/deployment issues with Anchor:
  - Multiple failed attempts to build and deploy the contract
  - Errors related to missing program files and compilation issues
  - Hanging processes that required manual termination

### UI Development Progress
- Set up React project structure with TypeScript
- Configured Tailwind CSS for styling
- Implemented wallet connection functionality using Solana Wallet Adapter
- Created basic dashboard component with wallet integration
- Built pet list view with mock data
- Created reusable pet card component

### Next Steps
1. Resolve smart contract build issues:
   - Investigate missing program file errors
   - Fix compilation errors in Rust code
   - Successfully deploy contract to devnet
2. Continue UI development:
   - Implement pet profile view
   - Create forms for adding new pets
   - Build QR code display functionality
   - Develop veterinarian portal
   - Create public viewer interface
3. Integrate UI with smart contract:
   - Connect wallet to contract functions
   - Fetch and display on-chain pet data
   - Implement record addition flows
