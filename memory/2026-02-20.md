## Pet Passport Project Work
- Successfully built the project with `anchor build`
- Attempted to run tests with `anchor test` but the process failed (likely due to missing devnet configuration)
- Set Solana config to devnet
- Attempting deployment with `anchor deploy` (currently in progress)
- Next steps: Complete deployment, verify program on-chain, and update documentation
