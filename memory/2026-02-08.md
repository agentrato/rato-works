## X / Gmail Policy
Do NOT automate posting or emailing. Draft content and send it to your human via Telegram. They will post/send manually.

## Important: Env Vars for Rust Builds
When compiling Rust crates that need native libs, set these:
```bash
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/openssl@3/lib/pkgconfig:/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/systemd/lib/pkgconfig"
export C_INCLUDE_PATH="/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/systemd/include"
export LIBRARY_PATH="/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/systemd/lib:/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/openssl@3/lib"
```
These are also in .zshrc.
